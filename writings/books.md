These are some of the books I've read over the years. I've only kept track intermittently, so there are some pretty big gaps!

*Hillbilly Elegy* by J. D. Vance. Eye-opening and provocative. From [my review](/writings/hillbilly-elegy/): The book is an autobiographical account by Vance (who’s only 35) of his journey from a rough, rough upbringing in hillbilly America to a university education ending with Yale Law School. I appreciated the empathetic writing style from the introduction, where he speaks of those he grew up around and identifies with: “Americans call them hillbillies, rednecks, or white trash. I call them neighbors, friends, and family.”

*A Different Shade of Green* by Gordon Wilson. I really enjoyed Wilson's obvious love of creation and little creatures and the like, simply because they're beautiful and God made them. And a book on this subject by a conservative Christian is a much-needed thing. However, I found it a bit simplistic overall, and I found his constant use of the terms "dominion" and "Biblical dominion" a bit tiresome. Could have been more thoughtful and in-depth, and could definitely have used better editing.

*Surprised by Hope* by N. T. Wright. TODO

*Come Back, Barbara* by C. John Miller and Barbara Miller Juliana. Compelling true story about the prodigal daughter of minister-missionary "Jack" Miller, and how Jack and his wife learn to let go and stop trying to be the Holy Spirit in the life of their wayward daughter. The amount they had to learn to let go is humbling. Franci and I read this separately and both found it very thought-provoking.

*Nate Saint: On a Wing and a Prayer* by Janet & Geoff Benge. Excellent kid-friendly biography of Nate Saint, one of the five missionaries who was killed at the hands of Auca spears in 1956. Such a powerful story.

*The Man who was Thursday* by G. K. Chesterton. A wild romp of a book about a group of conspirators who end up all being undercover cops. As much as I love Chesterton, this book was weird. Is it just a crazy story, or does it have some deeper meaning?

*Outlaws of Time: The Legend of Sam Miracle* by N. D. Wilson. A wild, Wilsonian romp complete with time travel, a native American healer, and a boy with snake arms. Read this out loud with Franci.

*The Household and the War for the Cosmos* by C. R. Wiley. Another very good book by the same author. In some ways this is a prequel to *Man of the House* and gives the underlying philosophy for his approach.

*Man of the House* by C. R. Wiley. Dumb cover, but amazing book, unlike any other I've read. Paints an incredible picture of what the household is for and could look like.

<em>Taken from a [list I wrote on our blog](https://aliensintheapple.com/2012/03/24/books-weve-read-recently/).</em>

For your interest, here's a list of some of the books we've read in the last year or so, with a tiny summary of each. Most of them are really good. I've put B after the author's name if only I've read it, F if just Franci's read it, or BF if we've both read it. Feel free to ask further about specific books if you'd like!

So here goes, in more or less our reading order:

<em>The Reason for God</em> by Tim Keller (B). Great book by the well-known New York City pastor answering doubts about and defending the Christian faith from a thinking point of view.

<em>Total Truth</em> by Nancy Pearcey (B). A lengthy but very readable look at how Christianity is not just a private matter, but should affect the public sphere as well. Some overlap with Keller's book.

<em>The Hobbit</em>, by J. R. R. Tolkien (B). I read this to Marica almost a year ago now.

<em>The Good of Affluence: Seeking God in a Culture of Wealth</em> by John Schneider (B). A thought-provoking discussion about how wealth can be compatible with Christianity. Schneider critiques left-leaning folks such as Ronald Sider.

<em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</em> by Betty Smith (BF). Really engaging novel written from the perspective of a girl from a very poor family in Brooklyn, set around 1912.

<em>The Dragon's Tooth</em> by N. D. Wilson (BF). Doug Wilson's son has a serious imagination. A strange and full-on but compelling story, definitely American rather than British. Complete with its own <a href="http://vimeo.com/27156974">book trailer video</a>.

<em>One Thousand Gifts</em> by Ann Voskamp (F). A book that transformed Franci's outlook on life to becoming more thankful to God for everything -- from the simple to the profound.

<em>My Name is Asher Lev</em> and <em>The Chosen</em> (BF) and <em>The Gift of Asher Lev</em> and <em><em>The Promise</em></em>, all by Chaim Potok (F). Very readable and interesting novels, all about orthodox Jewish boys and their interaction with the "outside world".

<em>When People are Big and God is Small</em> by Ed Welch (F). An interesting look at keeping things in perspective, and overcoming the fear of man.

<em>Loving the Little Years</em> by Rachel Jankovic (BF). A very encouraging look at how to pursue motherhood joyfully. One of Franci's favourite books about mothering kids.

<em>A Book of Bees: And How to Keep Them</em> by Sue Hubbell (F). A creative look at bee farming -- Franci said it's a great read whether or not you'll ever keep bees.

<em>C. S. Lewis: A Biography</em> by A. N. Wilson (B). Very interesting, though too Freudian for my taste, and somewhat factually incorrect. <a href="http://www.lewisiana.nl/definitivebiography/index.htm">Here's a thoughtful, critical review</a> of this biography.

<em>The Four Loves</em> by C. S. Lewis (B). Discusses four kinds of love: affection, friendship, romance, and charity. Very perceptive in places, though overall not one of my favourite Lewis books.

<em>Sleeping Murder</em> and <em>The Murder at the Vicarage</em> by Agatha Christie (F). The first and last of the Mrs Marple detective stories. A light and easy read.

<em>Heaven is for Real</em> by Todd Burpo (F). The account of a father whose young son had a near-death experience and described things he saw in heaven, despite never having been taught about those things. Franci said it was a fascinating read, even if she didn't agree with it all. She was expecting much worse after reading <a href="http://www.challies.com/book-reviews/heaven-is-for-real">this very negative review</a>.

<em>Lord Peter</em> (a collection of Lord Peter Whimsey stories) by Dorothy Sayers (F). Sayers is a fantastic mystery writer, and Franci marvels at how she comes up with such different scenarios for each of her stories.

<em>Charlotte's Web</em> by E. B. White (F). Franci read this classic to Marica recently.

<em>The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories</em> by O. Henry (BF). Punchy, twist-at-the-end short stories.

<em>Wordsmithy: Hot Tips for the Writing Life</em> by Douglas Wilson (BF). Short and fun book with things writers should think about. Not the usual list of grammatical advice.

<em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, by C. S. Lewis (B). I just finished reading the last of these to Marica (for the second time). Brilliant, and they get better every time.
