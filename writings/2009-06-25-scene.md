<p><i>Do you like the demoscene? Or do you just like smaller, faster, or embedded code? Read on.</i></p>

<p>When I was 14, I started learning how to program, for at least two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>My dad could code, and he made some neat stuff, like a code-generating <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/pentomino.fs">pentomino puzzle solver</a> and a <a href="/writings/snappy-software/#comment-2442">really tiny pop-up editor</a>.</li>
<li>Because I really liked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scratch that. I <i>still like</i> the demoscene. I mean, who else can make incredible 3D <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3397">tube</a> or <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=4659">lattice</a> demos in a <b>256-byte executable?</b> Try them — both still run fine under Windows XP.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2009_06_phyure_stars.zip"><img style="width:auto" alt="Fire effect and starfield" class="border right" height="158" src="/images/brushblog/2009_06_phyure_stars.png" title="Click to download the source code for my old fire effect and starfield" width="195"/></a>So I read diskmags and tutes to learn how to program the VGA hardware, push pixels to <code>0xA000:0000</code>, and use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_X">Mode X</a>. Oh, and I learnt about <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> before I learnt at school — for basic 2D and 3D rotation. Then there were effects: the fire effect, plasma, starfields, wormholes, etc, etc. (Click on the piccy to the right to download some of my old source.)</p>

<p>Anyway, back from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G_aUxbbqWU">Second Reality</a> to the real thing …</p>

<p>As I’ve noted before, I’m <a href="/writings/adobe-reader-9/">not exactly in favour</a> of bloatware. But in today’s “a GB here, a GB there” world, <b>is small still beautiful?</b> I think so, for two reasons:</p>

<h4>Embedded programming</h4>

<p>In the embedded world, size still matters a lot. Microcontrollers are getting bigger and faster, sure, but in electronic products there’s often a place for the small ones (say 64KB flash, 2KB RAM). Just the other day, I cut our code size by 900 bytes, which was a significant percentage of the total — less code to download, test, and maintain.</p>

<p>And it’s not only important for small micros, but also to limit download time and cost for in-field updates. If you want to update code for 1000 units over a fairly slow and costly radio link, small is good.</p>

<p><b>Binary diffs</b> or deltas are really good for this. My brother Berwyn has developed a proof-of-concept binary diffing algorithm which is designed for tiny embedded systems — <a href="http://brush.co.nz/contact">contact us</a> if you’re keen to hear more.</p>

<p>Binary diffing isn’t new, of course — <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/">bsdiff</a> already does something similar for Firefox’s updates, so you only need to download a small update. But bsdiff doesn’t work on small embedded systems, because it uses a compression program which requires a fair amount of RAM (bzip2).</p>

<h4>To go fast, do less</h4>

<p>Yep, as <a href="http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-write-fast-code.html">the guy said</a>: <i>To go fast, do less.</i></p>

<p>And KISS. Keeping it Short and Simple means less code to test, and if you’re using basically the right approach and algorithm, it usually also means <i>faster</i> code. And to follow my own advice, I’m keeping this section short.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>In a word, if you’re a budding hacker, or the parent of a budding hacker, teach them that small is still beautiful. And get ’em started with the demoscene. There is still a pretty active ‘scene community, and here are some starting points:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">Wikipedia article on the demoscene</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pouet.net/">Pouet.net</a>, a great place to download popular demos</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scene.org/">Scene.org</a>, another good ‘scene resource</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree. I work for Bittorrent, and we still manage to reduce code-size in uTorrent even at this late stage in the program’s development. More room for new features!</p>
