<h1>C++ for C programmers, part 1 of 2</h1>
<p class="subtitle">May 2010</p>

<p><img style="width:auto" alt="" class="right border" height="251" src="/images/brushblog/2010_05_cpp.jpg" title="The C++ Programming Language" width="200"/>As <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#C-slash">Stroustrup said</a>, there’s no such programming language as C/C++. C and C++ are two different beasts.</p>

<p>I’m not going to argue here about which is better. For small or embedded projects, the <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/">complexities</a> of C++ can get in the way. For larger projects, some of the <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/">features</a> of C++ are very useful.</p>

<p>I’m simply going to list the <strong>features C++ adds to C</strong>, from an ex-C programmer’s point of view (yes, I was one of those people who believed that C++ was just “C with classes”). The idea is to follow the links to further information if you want to know more about any of them.</p>

<p>This is part 1 of 2, the <strong>non-OO features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/91563f79(VS.80).aspx">Default arguments</a> to functions: defining <code>int read(int bufsize =512)</code> means that if you call <code>read()</code> without arguments it’s like you called <code>read(512)</code>.</li>
<li>Somewhat related is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t42e4h8(v=VS.80).aspx">function overloading</a>. You can define a function twice, with two different argument lists. The compiler will use the “closest match” when you call it. For example, defining <code>int print(int n) {...}</code> and <code>int print(const char* s) {...}</code> means you can <code>print()</code> both ints and char strings.</li>
<li>The compiler uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kbd4xa4d(v=VS.80).aspx">ambiguity resolution</a> to resolve all these overloaded functions.</li>
<li>You can declare local variables wherever in the code you need them, not just at the start of a function (also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99#Design">C99 feature</a>). This means variables can be declared closer to where you use them. The variable is scoped to the <code>{...}</code> block you put it in.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/references.html#faq-8.1">References</a>, as in <code>int&amp; x</code>. This isn’t some <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yk97tc08(VS.80).aspx">weird Microsoft-only syntax</a> for smart pointers. I started to think of these as pointers without all the <code>*</code>‘s, but they’re <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/57483/difference-between-pointer-variable-and-reference-variable-in-c">quite different</a>. An alias is another name for the referred-to object, usually used for pass-by-reference — and unlike pointers, you can call say <code>swap(x, y)</code> instead of <code>swap(&amp;x, &amp;y)</code>. A <code>const</code> reference means you’re not allowed to change the object it refers to.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Const-correctness">Const-correctness</a> in general. This is not just a C++ thing, but C++ folks tend to be stricter about it (usually for good reason).</li>
<li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace_(computer_science)#C.2B.2B">namespace</a> just groups a bunch of names together (functions or variables). C should have had them all along, to avoid everyone having to use their own brand of <code>mylib_myfunc()</code> pseudo-namespaces. See also the <code><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/">using</a></code><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/"> keyword</a> in its various forms.</li>
<li>The built-in <a href="http://www.glenmccl.com/bool_cmp.htm">boolean type</a>, <code>bool</code>, with <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> keywords (also in C99 via <code>stdbool.h</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>inline</code> keyword and <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/inline-functions.html">associated quirks</a>, including implicit inlining and auto-inlining.</li>
<li>Most people don’t realise it, but <code>(not f or n == 5)</code> is both valid Python and valid C++, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso646.h">ISO646-style operator keywords</a>.</li>
<li>A much larger standard library than C. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Standard Template Library (STL)</a> is definitely worth knowing, especially the container datatypes like <code>vector</code> (growable array) and <code>map</code> (associative array), and the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/">STL algorithms</a> such as <code>find()</code> and <code>sort()</code>. C++’s <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/">iostreams</a> are just plain weird (I mean, using the bit-shift operators to print stuff out?), but they’re here to stay. Of course, you can still use all of C’s standard library, and if you <code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, you’ll get the names in the <code>std</code> namespace, as in <code>std::printf()</code>.</li>
<li>Linking C++ code to C code has <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/mixing-c-and-cpp.html">several gotchas</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please send your feedback, and let me know if I’ve missed any non-OO features. The following week’s entry contains the <a href="/writings/cpp-2/" title="C++ for C programmers, part 2 of 2">second part</a> describing the object-oriented features C++ has added.</p>

<h3>Fabien <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">3 May 2010, 23:50</span></h3>

<p>You forgot the most important: </p>

<p>Don’t use malloc, free, new[], delete[], or even delete.</p>

<p>Do use std::string, std::vector&lt;&gt;, and smart pointers.</p>

<h3>Loup Vaillant <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">4 May 2010, 00:37</span></h3>

<p>Talking about gotchas, I prefer <a href="http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/mixing.html" rel="nofollow">the FQA</a> over the FAQ. Quite depressing, but more entertaining.</p>

<h3>Jason Baker <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">4 May 2010, 00:47</span></h3>

<p>You might want to consider calling this part “1 of 2”.  I was trying to figure out exactly what part one half meant.  :-)</p>

<h3>José Carlos Penfield da … <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">4 May 2010, 02:18</span></h3>

<p>Hi ! </p>

<p>The tutorial is excellent and is now part of my bookmarks, under the heading of useful tips. </p>

<p>However, i can’t let a comment pass uncommented. :)</p>

<p>The advice of not using new, new[] and their associates delete and delete[] is rather questionable.</p>

<p>C and C++ share the same philosophy of supposing a programmer aware of the risks. The languages usually trade extreme security for extreme performance.</p>

<p>And while malloc()/calloc() and free() should be generally avoided in terms of orthodox C++ programming, sometimes their use is recommended. For instance, when you got to pass a pointer to a C library.</p>

<h3>Kevin Bowling <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">4 May 2010, 07:08</span></h3>

<p>Looking forward to part 2.</p>

<h3>caf <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">10 Aug 2010, 17:44</span></h3>

<p>You might want to mention that `inline’ is also a co-feature with C99.</p>

<h3>coder <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">26 Aug 2010, 05:46</span></h3>

<p>Thanks for posting this, I have this book, but a lot of things have changed since this book has been published. Thanks again for posting this! :-)</p>

<h3>Coder <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">23 Nov 2010, 06:35</span></h3>

<p>Thanks for posting this information, very helpful when comparing C and C++, thanks again! :-)</p>

<h3>Geoffrey Hunter <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">23 Oct 2012, 11:20</span></h3>

<p>I would be interested to know why malloc is ‘acceptable’ in C yet frowned upon in C++.</p>

<h3>Ben <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">23 Oct 2012, 11:45</span></h3>

<p>@Geoffrey: in embedded systems, you often don’t use either malloc or free (heap allocation can be dangerous). But to answer your question more generally, here’s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/184540/68707" rel="nofollow">StackOverflow answer on that</a> — basically new is usually better because it’s type safe and calls your constructors.</p>

<h3>Sayeed Sezan <span style="padding-left: 1em; color: #bbb;">28 Nov 2012, 08:36</span></h3>

<p>Your post so is informative. I like C and C++ programming. thanks</p>
