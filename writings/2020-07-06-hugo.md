<p>Static web site generators have become more common in the last few years, with popular site generators written in each of the major programming languages. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is written in Go and is optimized for speed, though it is a flexible tool that can be configured for a variety of use cases: simple blogs, project documentation, larger news sites, and even government services.</p>


<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Static site generators have probably been around since the invention of HTML: most sites have a common header and footer, and site owners don't want to copy and paste that manually into each of their pages. Back then developers would be more likely to write a few dozen lines of custom Perl or Bash to string their HTML together. That approach definitely works, but today's static site generators are faster and more powerful than a simple custom script.</p>

<p>A lot of sites solve this by dynamically rendering the content on every page view, for example, by using PHP connected to an SQL database. In 2020, developers might be more likely to use a React frontend connected to an HTTP API that serves the content. Both of these setups, however, are overkill when a site just needs to serve some mostly-static content.</p>

<p>I believe the recent pushback against over-complicated dynamic architectures is healthy. Most personal sites and blogs, as well as project and company documentation sites, can be generated statically. Serving pre-rendered HTML is faster and more reliable than serving dynamically-rendered content. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page#Advantages_of_a_static_website">lists</a> some of the advantages static websites provide:</p>

<div class="BigQuote">
<ul>
    <li>Improved security over dynamic websites (dynamic websites are at risk to web shell attacks if a vulnerability is present)</li>
    <li>Improved performance for end users compared to dynamic websites</li>
    <li>Fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Of course, some web sites (particularly web applications) will always require dynamic content. Even LWN, whose articles are entirely static, needs to be able to serve different content for logged-in subscribers and non-logged-in visitors. So there will always be a need for dynamic servers and APIs. But when a site's content is static and public, or when any dynamic content can be handled on the client side, a static site generator will significantly simplify the system.</p>

<p>Because static site generators are relatively easy to build, there are many open source options available. All of the major programming languages have fairly popular offerings, for example: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> in Ruby, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> in Python, <a href="https://jbake.org/">JBake</a> in Java, <a href="https://sculpin.io/">Sculpin</a> in PHP, <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> in JavaScript, as well as <a href="https://github.com/pinceladasdaweb/Static-Site-Generators">hundreds of others</a>. This article covers Hugo, which is written in the Go programming language, and is one of the most popular static site generators overall (measured by that very rough measure, GitHub stars).</p>

<p>Hugo was created in 2013 by Steve Francia (now a member of the core Go team), but Bj√∏rn Erik Pedersen took over as lead developer in 2015. The project is <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">hosted on GitHub</a> and is currently 43,000 lines of Go source (excluding comments) licensed under the permissive Apache License 2.0. It has a thorough <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">documentation site</a> built, of course, using Hugo. The project also has a relatively high-traffic <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/">discussion forum</a> and a large number of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">themes</a>, many of which look quite well designed.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter too much what programming language a site generator is written in (I personally use Jekyll but have never needed to write Ruby), but developers often lean towards a tool that's written in a language they're familiar with. Even if a developer uses Hugo, they will probably never have to write Go, though if they are building or customizing a theme, they may need to dip into Go's HTML templating syntax.</p>

<p><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Hugo">According to BuiltWith</a>, Hugo usage has grown sharply over the last three years, and is used by several notable projects, including the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here/">redesigned Smashing Magazine site</a>, the <a href="https://gohugo.io/showcase/1password-support/">1Password Support site</a> and <a href="https://blog.1password.com/better-faster-stronger-our-new-blog-and-how-we-made-it/">blog</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/971755920639307777">Let's Encrypt</a> web site, <a href="https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov#development-guide">as well as</a> the U.S. government site <a href="https://digital.gov/">Digital.gov</a>.</p>


<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>When run without options, <tt>hugo</tt> traverses the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> files in the <tt>content</tt> directory and outputs rendered HTML to a directory named <tt>public</tt>. All of this is configurable &mdash; the default config file is <tt>config.toml</tt> in the root of the project. Output is rendered according to a "theme", which is a handful of Go HTML templates that define exactly what HTML is generated. The theme includes CSS styling as well as any images or JavaScript files needed for the theme.</p>

<p>Before writing this article, I set up a <a href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/">simple test site</a> with three articles and an "about" page &mdash; the kind of thing one might use for a personal web site or blog. It took about 30 minutes to choose a theme, configure Hugo, and add some dummy content. Hugo <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">can be installed</a> from popular operating system package managers, pre-built binaries on GitHub (Linux and BSD, macOS, and Windows), or built from source. For Hugo, building from source is as simple as installing Go (if it is not already installed), cloning the project, and typing <tt>go build</tt>. The following commands took about 20 seconds on my machine:</p>

<pre>
    $ git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
    Cloning into 'hugo'...
    [ ... ]
    $ go build
    go: downloading github.com/alecthomas/chroma v0.7.3
    go: downloading github.com/pkg/errors v0.9.1
    go: downloading github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure v1.1.2
    go: downloading github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify v1.4.7
    [ ... ]
    $ ./hugo version
    Hugo Static Site Generator v0.74.0-DEV darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
</pre>

<p>During development, typing <tt>hugo server</tt> starts a local web server to serve the rendered content from RAM. In this mode, Hugo automatically watches the files and rebuilds as needed. There's even some JavaScript in the client to automatically reload the page in the web browser as soon as that piece of content is changed. Hugo's built-in server is production-ready, but it's usually simpler for deployment to pre-build and upload the rendered files to a static site host such as Amazon S3, or serve them behind a regular web server such as Nginx.</p>

<p>Like other static site generators, Hugo uses a simple file format for pages that consists of "front matter" in YAML format, separated from the Markdown content by <tt>---</tt> lines. Here is the content for the <a href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/posts/my-first-post/">first post</a> of my example site:</p>

<pre>

    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Ee equals em cee squared.
    Let's try a [link](https://benhoyt.com/) and **some bold text**.

    Another paragraph. Hugo seems to be working. Writing Markdown is nice.
</pre>

<p>To give an idea of what a Hugo theme template looks like, here's the <tt>single.html</tt> template that's part of the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/soho/">Soho</a> theme I used in my test (it renders a single blog article):</p>

<pre>
    {{ define &quot;main&quot; -}}
    &lt;div class=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

      {{ if ne .Type &quot;page&quot; -}}
      &lt;div class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;
        &lt;time datetime=&quot;{{ .Date.Format &quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z0700&quot; }}&quot;&gt;
            {{ .Date.Format &quot;Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}
        &lt;/time&gt;
        &amp;middot; {{ .ReadingTime }} min read
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {{- end }}

      {{ .Content }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    {{- end }}
</pre>

<p>Hugo supports "taxonomies", which are different ways of categorizing pages, and for each taxonomy it creates a page that lists all the articles with that taxonomy assigned. By default it creates "tags" and "categories" taxonomies, for example the "<a href="https://d2fhg5pkhfbcuz.cloudfront.net/categories/development/">Development</a>" category on my test site. The <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/">documentation</a> shows various ways of ordering taxonomies or adding metadata to them.</p>

<p>The tool supports various ways to control page URLs ("permalinks") in the rendered content, with the default of <tt>/:section/:filename/</tt> producing URLs like <tt>/posts/third-article/</tt>. These "directory URLs" are done by creating the rendered HTML file in a directory with an index file: <tt>/posts/third-article/index.html</tt>.</p>

<p>One of the more advanced features of Hugo is what it calls "<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>", which are small snippets of HTML (with parameters) that can be used to augment Markdown's limited functionality without falling back to HTML. There are many builtin shortcodes, for example <tt>gist</tt> (to include a GitHub Gist), <tt>highlight</tt> (syntax-highlighted code), and <tt>youtube</tt> (an inline YouTube video). For example, the following shortcode:</p>

<pre>
    {{&lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &gt;}}
</pre>

<p>will produce this HTML output:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;
      &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7Ft2ymGmfc?autoplay=1&quot;
          style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&quot;
          allowfullscreen title=&quot;YouTube Video&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Hugo also includes more advanced features such as generating a <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/">table of contents</a> from the headings within an article, alternative <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#list-of-content-formats">markup formats</a> (Markdown is the default), a CSS and JavaScript <a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/">asset pipeline</a>, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/">image processing</a> commands to resize and crop images.</p>

<p>Hugo is billed as being very fast, with its home page saying "<span>at &lt;1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second</span>". Smashing Magazine's 7500-page site <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/smashing-magazine-s-redesign-powered-by-hugo-jamstack/5826/9">apparently</a> built in around 13 seconds. This speed is due in part to it being written in Go, a language that compiles to native binaries (rather than an bytecode-interpreted language like Python), but partly due to various benchmarking and performance efforts that contributors have done over the years; for example, see the <a href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.63.0-relnotes/">release notes</a> for version 0.63 released in January 2020.</p>

<p>In general with static site generators, content authors need to be developers, or at least be familiar with using a text editor, Markdown, and Git. However, web host Netlify has an open source tool called <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> that allows non-developers to contribute using a WYSIWYG editor &mdash; the tool commits to a Git repository behind the scenes. Hugo's documentation has a <a href="https://gohugo.io/tools/frontends/">list</a> of other similar tools.</p>


<h4>Hosting options</h4>

<p>With static site generation, developers can choose to host the rendered output on any host or web server. Popular options are GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Netlify, or self-hosting using the Caddy or Nginx web servers. Hugo has a <a href="https://gohugo.io/categories/hosting-and-deployment">documentation page</a> with detailed setup information for various options.</p>

<p>For my test site, I decided to use Amazon S3 (with AWS's Cloudfront CDN in front of it). This is pretty simple to set up, and it will handle many millions of pageviews for just a few dollars per month. To upload the locally-built version to S3, I used the following AWS CLI command:</p>

<pre>
    $ aws s3 sync --acl=public-read --cache-control="max-age=60" \
        public s3://hugo-lwntest/
</pre>

<p>It would be straight-forward to use continuous integration (for example, GitHub Actions) to run a command like this on every commit to the site's Git repository, ensuring the rendered version is up to date at all times.</p>


<h4>Wrapping up</h4>

<p>Static site generators are a relatively simple way to build and deploy web sites with mostly static content. Hugo's speed, permissive license, and array of features make it an attractive choice for developers, whether it's for a small personal website or a large content-heavy one.</p>
