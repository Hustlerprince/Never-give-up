<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I’m a software engineer with fifteen years of experience developing web applications and services, as well as providing technical leadership for small teams of software developers.</p>

<p>I’m fluent in Go, Python, C, SQL, HTML, and English. I’ve also written a good amount of JavaScript, C++, and x86 assembly. I learn quickly, care about detail, and love computer science and mathematics.</p>

<p>I live in New Zealand, but have dual NZ / U.S. citizenship. I lived and worked in New York City from 2010 to 2019, and I’m open to remote work and some travel.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p>I have a B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and graduated from the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/">University of Canterbury</a> in 2002 with first class honors, <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/qualifications-and-courses/glossary-of-terms/#g" title="Scale: A+ is 9, D is 0">GPA</a> 7.9/9. For my final-year project I designed a small stack-based CPU in VHDL.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p class="right-callout">I have also discovered a truly marvelous proof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law">Hofstadter’s Law</a>, but unfortunately this margin is too narrow to contain it.</p>

<p>My dad taught me how to program by teaching me the Tao of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>. Two of my first projects were writing a Forth compiler in x86 assembly, and then writing a small 32-bit OS in my Forth. I love things small, fast, and light – and that’s paid off during my career.</p>

<p>Other than that, I enjoy reading and <a href="/writings/">writing</a>, and I once edited a <a href="/prism-magazine/">small print magazine</a>. I’m into unicycling, typography, and piano. I love my wife and family. I aim to keep the commandments, but you may find me breaking the conventions.</p>
