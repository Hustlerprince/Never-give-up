<h2 id="introduction">Introduction: Why a PEW?</h2>

<p>Because if it ain't in plain English, it ain't worth reading.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, the reason I started writing the PEW was because I was teaching the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith">Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF)</a> to 14-year-old catechism students, and trying to work through a 360-year-old document written in archaic and somewhat academic prose is tough going!</p>

<p>Translating the WCF—if you can call it translation—helped me get my head around what it teaches. I also found that using the PEW alongside the <a href="http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/">original</a> helped my students understand the confession better.</p>

<p>The fact is that 1646 is a long time ago, and English has changed a lot since then, both our vocabulary and the way we structure our sentences. We acknowledge this when we use NIV and ESV Bibles rather than the King James Version. So why not do the same with our confessions, which were written in the same era? If we're going to be a confessional church, then our confessions need to be kept alive.</p>

<p>I don't think the original WCF or its exact wording is particularly holy. Whatever I might think about translating the Bible, I believe that a thought-for-thought translation is much more likely to keep the WCF alive than a word-for-word translation.</p>

<p>The OPC's <a href="http://opc.org/documents/MESV.html">Modern English Study Version (MESV)</a> is a great start, and I often used it when I got stuck with something in the original. It's a good modernisation, but they've definitely taken more of a word-for-word approach that I have. If their version is the NASB, think of this as the NIV.</p>

<p>Of course, the MESV seems to be a very careful update, whereas the PEW is a one-man job that I don't intend to be used for more than personal study or as a teaching tool. If you want to really dig into the confession, consult the original, or even better, make your own paraphrase.</p>

<p>Me publishing this is not intended either to <a href="http://spindleworks.com/library/wcf/ward.htm">defend</a> or to <a href="http://www.christianstogether.net/Articles/298219/Christians_Together_in/Christian_Life/The_Westminster_Confession.aspx">disagree with</a> the teachings in the confession. But where there are disagreements, at least we'll now be able to understand what we're disagreeing with!</p>

<p><b>If you have feedback or constructive critism, do send it through.</b> And if you like the PEW or are using it in your own class, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Holy Scripture</h2>

<p>1. God's creation and His care for everything tell us a lot about Him: that He's good, wise and powerful. So we have no excuses—God will judge us. But creation and providence aren't enough for us to know God and His will in the deep way that saves us.</p>

<p>Because of this, God decided to reveal Himself and His will more clearly to us with His Word. He did this at many times and in various ways, and He made sure the whole work was written down to keep it safe—to preserve and pass down the truth, and to establish the Church and protect it against sin, Satan and the world.</p>

<p>Now that we have the Holy Scriptures, God has stopped revealing His will to us in the ways that he used to.</p>

<p>2. The Holy Scriptures, also known as the written Word of God or the Bible, contains all the books of the Old and New Testaments. All of these books are inspired by God, and are intended to show us what to believe and how to live.</p>

<p>The books of the Old Testament are: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1&nbsp;Samuel, 2&nbsp;Samuel, 1&nbsp;Kings, 2&nbsp;Kings, 1&nbsp;Chronicles, 2&nbsp;Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p>

<p>And the books of the New Testament are: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1&nbsp;Corinthians, 2&nbsp;Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1&nbsp;Thessalonians, 2&nbsp;Thessalonians, 1&nbsp;Timothy, 2&nbsp;Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1&nbsp;Peter, 2&nbsp;Peter, 1&nbsp;John, 2&nbsp;John, 3&nbsp;John, Jude, and Revelation.</p>

<p>3. The books in the Apocrypha aren't part of the Bible, because they're not inspired by God. This means they don't have authority for the Church. Instead, we should treat the books in the Apocrypha just like other human writings.</p>

<p>4. The authority of the Bible comes completely from God, not from man or from the Church. God is Truth, and because He's the Bible's author, it should be believed, obeyed, and accepted as the Word of God.</p>

<p>5. The Church’s teaching can help us highly regard and reverence the Bible. And the book itself contains a lot of evidence that it’s the Word of God:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Its heavenly subject matter</li>
 <li>Its effective teaching</li>
 <li>Its majestic style</li>
 <li>The harmony of all the different parts</li>
 <li>Its scope—to give all glory to God</li>
 <li>How it completely reveals the only way to be saved</li>
 <li>How the whole work is perfect</li>
 <li>And many other amazing highlights</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, to be fully persuaded that the Bible is true and error-free and speaks with God's authority, we need to have the Holy Spirit working inside us. The Spirit assures our hearts of these truths.</p>

<p>6. Everything we need to know about God’s glory and our salvation and life, God has either written in the Bible directly, or allowed us to deduce from the Bible using our reasoning. Nothing should ever be added to it, whether it’s a “revelation from the Spirit” or simply a man-made tradition.</p>

<p>That said, the Holy Spirit does need to light up our hearts so we can understand the Bible’s teaching in a way that saves us. There are also things we need to determine using Christian wisdom, nature, and general human practice—for example, the external aspects of worship, and exactly how Church government should work. Even these should be done according to the general rules of the Bible, which we should always follow.</p>

<p>7. Not everything in Scripture is equally obvious, and not all teachings are equally clear to everyone. But what we need to know and believe and do to be saved—these things are so clearly taught in different parts of Scripture, that both the theologian and the “man in the pew” can understand them using readily-available methods.</p>

<p>8. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, the native language of God’s people in olden times. The New Testament was written in Greek, which was the most widespread language at the time of writing. The two testaments in these original languages were directly inspired by God. They’ve been kept pure down through the ages, so they’re authoritative, and the Church should settle any religious controversies using these originals.</p>

<p>However, most of God’s people today don’t know these original languages, but it’s still very important that we can read the Bible—in fact, we have a right to. We’re commanded to read and study it with a proper fear of God, so it must be translated into the native language of every nation we go to. Then the Word of God will live fully in all of us, and we’ll be able to worship Him as we should. The Scriptures will give us patience and comfort, and lead us to hope.</p>

<p>9. We should interpret the Bible using the Bible itself. When we have questions about the exact meaning of a part of Scripture (and there’s one meaning, not many), we should study the whole Bible to find passages that speak more clearly.</p>

<p>10. The highest judge that can settle any religious controversy is none other than the Holy Spirit speaking through the Bible. Statements by church councils, opinions of ancient writers, human teachings, and private revelations—all these should be judged by this Highest Judge. We’re to trust His judgement fully.</p>


<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: God and the Holy Trinity</h2>

<p>1. There is only one living and true God. He’s infinite and perfect. He’s pure and invisible spirit. He doesn’t have a body, multiple parts, or human passions. He doesn’t change. He’s immense, eternal, and unable to be fully understood. He’s all-powerful, very wise, very holy, totally free, and totally absolute. He works out everything in a way that matches His unchanging and righteous will, and for His own glory.</p>

<p>God is very loving, gracious, full of mercy and patience, overflowing with goodness and truth. He forgives our wrong-doing and sin. He rewards everyone who diligently seeks Him. But He’s also very just—His judgements can be terrifying, because He hates all sin and certainly won’t let the guilty off the hook.</p>

<p>2. God has all life, glory, goodness, and blessing in Himself. All these things come from Him. Only He is fully self-sufficient—He doesn’t need any of the creatures He’s made. And He doesn’t get His glory from them, but instead reveals His glory in and through them.</p>

<p>God is the source, the fountain, of all existence. Everything exists for Him and because of Him. He has absolute power over everything. He can do what He wants to anything, using anything, and for anything.</p>

<p>His eyes see everything clearly. His knowledge is infinite and never fails, and it doesn’t depend on His creatures—nothing’s uncertain or conditional in His mind. He is completely holy in all His decisions, actions, and commands.</p>

<p>He deserves worship and obedience. People, angels, and all other creatures must worship and obey Him as He commands.</p>

<p>3. God is one God but three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. All three are one in their core being. They’re one in power. They’re one through all time.</p>

<p>The Father comes from no one—He was not fathered by the Son or the Spirit, nor does He originate from them. The Son is fathered through all time by God the Father. The Holy Spirit originates through all time from both the Father and the Son.</p>


<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: God’s eternal decisions</h2>

<p>1. From before the beginning of time, God has decided and put into place everything that happens. He makes these decisions freely by his wise and holy will. Nothing he’s put into place can change.</p>

<p>Still, he orders everything in such a way that he’s not the originator of sin. And he doesn’t force us to do things against our will. He is the root cause of everything, but this doesn’t mean secondary causes are not involved—in fact, God is the reason other causes exist.</p>

<p>2. God knows everything that can happen based on any conditions, but he doesn’t put things into place by looking into the future and seeing what's going to happen.</p>

<p>3. To show his glory, God has ordered events so that some people and some angels are destined to eternal life, and others to eternal death.</p>

<p>4. He has counted and chosen a certain number of people and angels for each destiny. This number can’t be increased or decreased.</p>

<p>5. God selected people for eternal life, and he's chosen them in Christ for everlasting glory. He did this before the beginning of time, in line with his eternal and unchanging purpose, and his secret design.</p>

<p>He chose us with free grace and love, not because he saw ahead of time our faith or our good works, or how well we’d stick to them. In fact, nothing in us caused him to chose us—it was all down to his praise-worthy, amazing grace.</p>

<p>6. In the same way that God—by his eternal and free will—chose us for glory, he also planned the way that we’d be brought to him. All of us he’s chosen fell when Adam fell, are bought back by Christ, and when the time was right, are called by the Holy Spirit to have faith in Christ.</p>

<p>We’re declared innocent, adopted as God’s children, and made clean. Through faith, we are kept for salvation by God’s power.</p>

<p>Only those God has chosen are called and saved in this way. Only they have been bought back by Christ.</p>

<p>7. God chose to overlook the rest of mankind, choosing to dishonour them and judge them for their sin. God can show or withhold mercy as he wants—difficult to understand, but this is his will. In doing this, he shows his glorious justice and his kingly power over his creatures.</p>

<p>8. The truth that God determines our destinies is a great mystery, a teaching that should be used wisely and handled with care. We should pay attention to God’s word and obey it. By hearing and obeying, we can be assured that we’re called and chosen to eternal life.</p>

<p>This teaching gives us many reasons to praise, reverence, and admire God. It helps us to be humble and diligent, and it's a real comfort to everyone who truly obeys the gospel.</p>


<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Creation</h2>

<p>1. To show His eternal power, wisdom, and goodness, God decided to create the whole world and everything in it. Everything we see and everything we can’t see he made out of nothing in six days. All of it was very good.</p>

<p>2. After God had made all the other creatures, he create mankind—he made us male and female. He gave us the ability to think and reason. He gave us souls that will live forever. He made us in his image, gifting us with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness.</p>

<p>He wrote his own law on our hearts. He gave us power to obey it, but also the possibility to disobey. He gave us freedom of will, and our will can change.</p>

<p>Aside from writing his law on our hearts, he commanded us not to eat the fruit from one tree—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. While we kept this command we were happy to be friends of God, and to rule over the other creatures.</p>


<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: Providence</h2>

<p>1. God, our great Creator, holds up all things, directs them, and tears them down. From the biggest to the smallest, he governs everything. This wise and holy care is called God’s “providence”.</p>

<p>God governs according to his perfect knowledge of everything in the future, and in line with his free and unchanging will. His providence deserves our praise—for his wisdom, power, justice, goodness, and mercy.</p>

<p>2. God plans and knows everything before it happens. He’s the “first cause”, so everything goes according to his plan, without fail or change. However, by this same providence he makes events happen using secondary causes. These are “cause and effect” causes—events depend on them, or happen freely despite them, or seem to be forced by them.</p>

<p>3. God usually uses secondary causes or “means” to govern events. But if he wants to, he’s free to work without these ordinary means, or above them, or against them.</p>

<p>4. God’s providence shows us his great power, his hard-to-understand wisdom, and his infinite goodness. This in turn shows us all that his providence covers—even the first fall of mankind, and all other sins of people and angels.</p>

<p>He doesn’t just give these things permission to happen however they want. No, it’s a wise, limited permission. He governs even these events in various ways for his own holy reasons. However, the sinfulness of these things comes only from the creatures that do them, not from God himself. God is holy and righteous, and never originates or approves of sin—in fact, he can’t.</p>

<p>5. Our wise, righteous, and gracious God often lets us experience different temptations and feel the effects of our dirty hearts. But he only lets this happen for a time, in order to punish us for our sins, and to reveal how rotten and deceitful our hearts really are.</p>

<p>These trials humble us, and lift us up to help us lean on God more consistently. They make us more careful to guard against sin in the future, not to mention help us in many other ways.</p>

<p>6. God is a righteous judge, and he blinds and hardens wicked people for their sins. He keeps his grace from them—grace that would normally give them spiritual wisdom and changed hearts.</p>

<p>Sometimes he even takes away gifts they’d previously had, and exposes them to things their wicked hearts can turn into sin. He lets them fall into temptation and run with their evil desires, even letting Satan overpower them. Soon enough, they harden themselves using the same things God uses to soften others.</p>

<p>7. God’s providence governs all creatures in a general way, but in a very special way it cares for his Church. In fact, God works all things for the good of the Church.</p>


<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6: The Fall, sin and punishment</h2>

<p>1. Adam and Eve, our first parents, were seduced to eat the forbidden fruit by Satan's subtle tempting. God allowed them to sin like this because his purpose was to glorify himself, in line with his wise and holy design.</p>

<p>2. Adam and Eve were originally perfect, and able to talk to God directly, but because of this sin they fell. They were then sinful, dead, and dirty. Every part of their body and soul was now polluted.</p>

<p>3. Because they were the first parents, they passed down the guilt and death and pollution to all their children. And since then, it's been passed down from parent to child, right through all the generations.</p>

<p>4. All actual sins come from this original sin, a pollution which makes us totally unable and unwilling to do good. In fact, we oppose all good, and lean completely towards evil.</p>

<p>5. This polluted nature of ours remains in us during this life, even after we're born again. Even though it's forgiven and put to death through Christ, our pollution and all the effects of it are truly sin.</p>

<p>6. Every sin breaks God's righteous law and is contrary to it—both the original sin of Adam and Eve, and all the actual sins done after that. Every sin makes the sinner guilty, and as a result he comes under God's great anger and the curse of the law. He is then ruled by death and spiritual misery—misery both now and eternally.</p>


<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7: God's covenant with us</h2>

<p>1. God is our Creator; we are his creatures. He's very high above us, and it's our duty to obey him. But he doesn't reward us because we've worked so hard at obeying him. Instead, he voluntarily stoops down to our level and blesses us with promises, or covenants.</p>

<p>2. God's first covenant was with Adam. It is often called a "covenant of works": God promised life to Adam and his children—as long as they obeyed God perfectly.</p>

<p>3. When Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and fell, they simply could not keep that first covenant anymore. Life by the first covenant was over.</p>

<p>So God made a second covenant. This one is often called a "covenant of grace": God freely offers to give life to us sinners, and to save us by Jesus Christ. In this covenant, God requires us to have faith in him to be saved. He also promises to give us his Holy Spirit so that we can and want to believe.</p>

<p>4. In the Bible, this second covenant is often called a testament or will (or "covenant", in modern Bibles). This refers to the death of Jesus, the will-maker, who promises us an inheritance that will last forever.</p>

<p>5. God carried out this covenant differently in the time of the law and in the time of the gospel.</p>

<p>In the time of the law—the Old Testament—it was carried out by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the passover lamb, and the other symbols and ceremonies that God gave to the Jewish people. All of these were enough at that time. They all pointed forward to Christ. In fact, the Holy Spirit used all these ceremonies to give the people faith in the promised Messiah, Jesus. God's people during that time were still forgiven through Jesus. They were still saved for eternal life only through Him.</p>

<p>6. Now we're living in the New Testament—the time of the gospel, after Christ has come down to us as a man. God now carries out his covenant by the Bible being preached, and by giving us the sacraments—Baptism and the Lord's Supper. It seems much simpler now, and it's less of an outward show, and there are only a few ceremonies instead of a lot of them. But in spite of that, God uses these few "simple" things to show His covenant to both Jews and Gentiles more fully, more clearly, and more effectively.</p>

<p>In other words, there are not two different "covenants of grace". There's only one, but it's carried out in two different ways.</p>


<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8: Christ the mediator</h2>

<p>1. God chose his one and only son, Jesus, to be the mediator between him and us. And God has always had this plan—that Jesus would be our prophet, our priest, and our king. God chose Jesus to be the head of the Church, and to save it. Jesus will inherit everything, and judge the whole world.</p>

<p>God also gave us to Jesus. We are to be Jesus' own people. His children. In due time we'll each be called by him, and saved from sin, and made right with God. Jesus will make us cleaner and holier, and in the end He'll make us complete and perfect.</p>

<p>2. Jesus is the Son of God, sometimes called the "second person of the Trinity". He is and has always been truly God. He's one and the same being as God the Father, and equal with the Father.</p>

<p>When the time was right, Jesus became one of us. He took on the nature of mankind, complete with all of our characteristics and weaknesses—except sin. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit's power, and was in the womb of Mary, who was still a virgin. Jesus had the same kind of body as her.</p>

<p>In other words, Jesus has two distinct natures—divine and human. Both natures are complete and perfect. The divine and human were joined together into one person, but they stayed divine and human. Jesus isn't a mixture of God and man. He is truly God and truly man, but one Christ. He is the only mediator between God and man.</p>

<p>3. When Jesus became both human and divine, he was set apart and sacred, and was filled with the Holy Spirit to overflowing. He's been given all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom. God the Father wanted him filled with total abundance, so that he'd be holy, innocent, pure, and full of grace and truth. As a result, he was completely equipped to carry out his role as mediator.</p>

<p>Jesus did not make himself our mediator, but was called to this role by God the Father. The Father gave him all power and complete ability to judge, and commanded him to use it.</p>

<p>4. Jesus was called by God to be our mediator, but he carries out the role willingly. To carry it out, he had to obey the law of God, which he did perfectly. He had to endure terrible suffering in both body and soul. He was nailed to a cross, he died, and was buried. Death held him down for three days, but his body didn't decay.</p>

<p>On the third day, he rose from the dead with the same body he had suffered in. In this body he went up into heaven, where he sits at the right hand of God the Father. There he mediates and pleads with God for us. And he'll return from there to judge us and the angels at the end of the world.</p>

<p>5. Jesus obeyed God perfectly, and sacrificed himself for us. That goes for all God's people—all of us who have been given to Jesus by God the Father. Jesus offered his sacrifice to God through the Holy Spirit, and it fully satisfied God's justice, and brought us back into a close relationship with God. With his sacrifice, Jesus paid our debt, but he also bought us an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven which will last forever.</p>

<p>6. It was only after Jesus Christ became a man that we were actually saved—that we could say "the payment's gone through". But even before that, since the beginning of the world, God's people have been able to experience the goodness and power of being saved. This is because God revealed his salvation to his people through the Old Testament promises, symbols, and sacrifices.</p>

<p>These signs showed that Jesus is the descendant of Eve that would "crush the serpent's head". They showed that he is the "Lamb that was slain" since the beginning of the world. That he is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</p>

<p>7. As our mediator, Christ sometimes acts according to his divine nature, and sometimes according to his human nature, as appropriate. But because he's one person, sometimes in the Bible things Jesus does as a man are said to be done by God, and vice versa.</p>

<p>8. Christ always gives and applies salvation to everyone he's bought it for—us, his people. He mediates between us and God, and he shows us the mysteries of salvation in and through his Word. He persuades us by his Holy Spirit to believe and obey, and he governs our hearts by his Word and by his Spirit. He defeats all our enemies by his almighty power and wisdom, in ways that fit right in with his amazing plan.</p>


<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9: Free will</h2>

<p>1. God gave us freedom of will in the sense that we're not forced to do good or evil. Nature has not already determined whether we'll do good or evil.</p>

<p>2. When mankind was still innocent, before Adam and Eve's fall into sin, we were free and able to do good things that pleased God. But this had the potential to change. We were allowed to fall from innocence.</p>

<p>3. And we did fall—from innocence into sin. By the fall we lost the ability to choose any spiritual good that would help save us. So as fallen humans, we really don't like doing good. We're dead in sin, and by our own strength we're not able to convert ourselves, or even prepare ourselves to be converted.</p>

<p>4. When God converts us and gives us his grace, he frees us from being slaves of sin. By God's grace alone we're enabled to want to do spiritual good and to freely do it. But we still have some rottenness remaining in us, so we don't always want to do good. We sometimes want to do evil. And even when we want to do good, we don't do it perfectly.</p>

<p>5. We'll only have a truly free will when we're "raised in glory" at the resurrection. Our wills will then be perfect and free to only do good—they won't even have the potential to turn bad again.</p>


<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10: Effective calling</h2>

<p>1. God calls to himself all the people (and only those people) that he has destined to eternal life. It's an effective call in God's appointed time, by his Word and Spirit. It's a call out of our natural sin and death, and into grace and salvation by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>When God calls us, he lights up our minds spiritually, so that we can be saved and so we can understand the things of God. He takes out our heart of stone and gives us a heart of flesh. He renews our will, and makes us want to do good. He draws us powerfully to Jesus, but also makes us willing to come so that we come freely.</p>

<p>2. This effective call comes only from God's free grace, not anything God foresees in us. We're completely passive in this process, until God makes us alive and renews us by his Holy Spirit. Then we're enabled to answer God's call, and to embrace the grace he gives us.</p>

<p>3. Babies who are chosen by God but die young are made new and saved by Christ. They're saved through the Holy Spirit, who works in them when and where and how he pleases. The Spirit works in this same way in disabled people who have been chosen by God, and others who are unable to be called by the preaching of God's word.</p>

<p>4. Some people who are not chosen might be outwardly called by the preaching of God's word, and might experience some common operations of the Holy Spirit, but they never truly come to Christ, so they can't be saved. And people who don't profess to be Christians can't be saved in any other way, even if they try very hard to live a "good life" according to nature or their own religion. It's a very harmful heresy to believe that people can be saved in other ways.</p>


<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11: Justification</h2>

<p>1. God freely justifies all of us he has called. He justifies us not by filling us with righteousness, but by forgiving our sins, and by accepting and counting us as righteous.</p>

<p>God doesn't justify us because of anything worked into us or done by us, but only for Christ's sake. Neither does he justify us by declaring that our faith or our belief or our obedience count as our righteousness. Instead, God justifies us by declaring that Christ's obedience and payment for sin are now ours.</p>

<p>We need to respond by accepting and trusting in Christ and his righteousness by faith, remembering that even our faith is not from ourselves, but is a gift from God.</p>

<p>2. We are justified only by faith, that is, by accepting and trusting in Christ and his righteousness. So it's faith alone, but not a faith that is alone—our faith must go along with all the other graces that save us. It's not a dead faith, but works itself out in love.</p>

<p>3. By his obedience and death, Christ fully paid the debt of all of us who are justified. He really and fully satisfied God the Father's justice on our behalf.</p>

<p>But because our Father gave him for us freely, because he obeyed freely, and because his payment for sin was accepted freely and not based on anything in us, we are justified only by free grace. As God justifies us sinners, he wants to show both his strict justice and his rich grace.</p>

<p>4. It has been God's will since eternity past to justify us who are elect. And when the time was right, Christ died for our sins and rose again for our justification. However, we're not justified till the Holy Spirit actually applies Christ to us in due time.</p>

<p>5. Even though we're justified, God continues to forgive the sins we do. We can't fall back out of justification, but we might sin and fall under God's fatherly disapproval for a time. Yet when we humble ourselves, confess our sins, plead for forgiveness, renew our faith and repent—then God's face will shine its light on us again.</p>

<p>6. In all these respects, believers in the Old Testament were justified in exactly the same way as we who believe in New Testament times.</p>


<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12: Adoption</h2>

<p>1. God guarantees to adopt all of us he has justified, in and for his son Jesus Christ. Adoption is a gift in which God gives us the freedoms and privileges of being his very own children. He gives us his own name. He gives us the spirit of adoption, and allows us to access his throne of grace boldly. He enables us to cry "Abba, Father".</p>

<p>Like a Father, God also has compassion on us, provides for us, and disciplines us. But he will never cast us off. Instead, he puts his seal on us for the day of redemption, when we will inherit the promises and be heirs of everlasting life.</p>


<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13: Sanctification</h2>

<p>1. After God has called us and given us new hearts and spirits, he sanctifies us. He does this in a real and personal way, through Christ's death and resurrection, and by his Word and Holy Spirit living in us.</p>

<p>Sanctification means that God is destroying the rule of sin in our lives. He weakens our sinful lusts more and more, and puts them to death. He makes us more and more alive, and makes us strong in the graces that save us and lead to true holiness—for without holiness no one will see the Lord.</p>

<p>2. Although God sanctifies each part of our being, in this life we'll never be perfect. There will always be some remnants of rottenness in every part of us. This leads to an ongoing war between two sides that will never make peace: our flesh fighting against our spirit, and our spirit fighting against our flesh.</p>

<p>3. In this war, our remaining rottenness might get the better of us for a time. But, by the strength of the Spirit that sanctifies, our born-again spirit will win in the end. And so we grow in grace, perfecting our holiness as we fear God.</p>


<h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14: Saving faith</h2>

<p>1. Faith is a gift God gives his chosen people so they can believe and be saved. It is a grace—a gift we don't deserve. The Holy Spirit works it in our hearts, usually by God's Word being preached. Our faith then grows and is strengthened by that same Word, as well as through prayer, baptism, and the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p>2. It's by faith that we believe God's word is true, because in his Word God's authority speaks for itself. We respond differently to what each passage contains—we obey the commands, tremble at the threatenings, and embrace God's promises for this life and for eternal life.</p>

<p>But the main way we act out our faith is by accepting, receiving, and relying on Jesus Christ. It's through Jesus alone that God can call us innocent, make us holy, and give us eternal life—all through the covenant of grace.</p>

<p>3. Faith varies in degrees. Some people have strong faith, some have weak faith. Often our faith is attacked and weakened, but it always wins the fight. Many people's faith grows enough so they can be fully assured about Christ. It's Christ who gives us faith in the first place as well as makes our faith perfect.</p>


<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15: Repentance that leads to life</h2>

<p>1. Repentance is a grace of the gospel that leads to life. Just like faith, repentance must be preached by every minister of the gospel.</p>

<p>2. By repentance we sense the danger of our sins, and see how filthy and horrible they are. We see how contrary our sins are to God's holy nature and law. By repentance we realise that God promises us mercy in Christ. We realise how much we need to grieve for and hate our sins, and turn from them to God, aiming to walk with God and keep his commandments.</p>

<p>3. We must not rely on our repentance, thinking that it will help pay for or forgive our sin. Our sin is only covered by God's free grace in Christ. Still, repentance is very necessary for each of us, and we shouldn't expect forgiveness without it.</p>

<p>4. There is no sin so small that it does not deserve to be condemned to hell. But there's no sin so large that it will condemn those who truly repent.</p>

<p>5. We shouldn't be content with just repenting of our sins generally. It's our duty to aim to repent of all our individual sins.</p>

<p>6. Each of us must privately confess our sins to God, and pray for forgiveness. When we're forgiven, and we leave our sins, God will show us mercy.</p>

<p>When we sin against and dishonour a brother or the Church, we must also confess our sins to the person or people we've offended—in private or publicly. We must be sorry for our sin, tell the person or people involved we repent, so they can then be reunited with us and receive us in love.</p>


<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16: Good works</h2>

<p>1. Good works are only the works God commands us to do in His word. They're not works people make up without grounding in Scripture, even if they do so out of blind zeal or with outwardly good intentions.</p>

<p>2. Good works are the fruit of a lively and true faith. We do them to obey God's commandments, and by them we show our thankfulness to God. Our good works assure us of salvation, build up our brothers, make our profession of the gospel beautiful, shut the mouths of our enemies, and glorify God.</p>

<p>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works. These works bear fruit that lead to holiness, so that in the end we may have eternal life.</p>

<p>3. Our ability to do good works definitely doesn't come from ourselves, but only from the Holy Spirit. To enable us to do good works, we need—apart from the grace we've already been given—the Spirit to influence us to desire and do what pleases God. But we must not get lazy, as if we don't have to do anything unless the Spirit specially tells us to. No, we need to be diligent to stir up the grace of God that is already in us.</p>

<p>4. Even people who obey God exceedingly well in this life are never are able to go above and beyond the call of God's duty. In fact, such people still fall short of a many things God requires them to do.</p>

<p>5. Even our best works won't earn us forgiveness of sin or eternal life with God—our best works are completely disproportionate to the glory to come, and the distance between us and God is infinite. We can't benefit God by our works or satisfy the debt of our sins. </p>

<p>When we've done all we can, we've simply done our duty and are unprofitable servants. As far as our deeds are good they come from the Holy Spirit, and because they're done by us they're unclean, weak, and imperfect, so they can't endure God's severe judgement.</p>

<p>6. But despite all this, God accepts us who believe through Christ, along with our works. He accepts us not because he sees our good works as pure and perfect, but because he looks at us through his Son. He wants to accept and reward what we do that's sincere, even if it is weak and imperfect.</p>

<p>7. Works done by unsaved people are sinful, even if they're things that God commands and useful to themselves or to others. This is because they don't come from a heart that has been cleaned by faith, they aren't done with right motives according to God's word, and they're not done with the right goal—to glorify God. So these works don't please God, or make someone suitable to receive God's grace. However, not doing them is even more sinful and displeasing to God.</p>


<h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17: Perseverance of the saints</h2>

<p>1. God has accepted us through his beloved son, has called us effectively, and is making us holy by his Spirit—all of us that he chooses in this way will persevere in grace to the end. We can never fall away from grace completely, but will be saved eternally.</p>

<p>2. We as saints persevere not because of our own free will, but because of our unchangeable election—God chose us, and he doesn't change his mind. This unchangeableness flows from the Father's unchangeable love, from Jesus' worthiness and intercession for us, from the Spirit constantly living in us, from God's seed planted in us, and from the nature of the covenant of grace. All of these things make us unmistakeably certain that we'll persevere.</p>

<p>3. However, because of the rottenness that remains in us, and because we neglect God's ways of preserving us, we may be tempted by Satan or the world and fall into serious sin. We may even continue in that sin for a time.</p>

<p>God is displeased with us when we do this, and it grieves the Holy Spirit. We may find that our graces and comforts are taken away, that our hearts are made hard and our consciences seared. Falling into sin like this will hurt and scandalise others, and bring temporary judgement on ourselves.</p>


<h2 id="chapter24">Chapter 24: Marriage and divorce</h2>

<p>1. Marriage must be between one man and one woman. It's against God's law for a man to have more than one wife, or for a woman to have more than one husband (at the same time—see points 5 and 6 for more about death and divorce).</p>

<p>2. God gave us marriage for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
 <li>To help both husband and wife, and to help them help each other</li>
 <li>To increase the population with legitimate children</li>
 <li>To provide the Church with godly young men and women</li>
 <li>And to prevent sexual immorality</li>
</ul>

<p>3. All sorts of different people are allowed to get married, as long as they're able to give their informed consent. In other words, to be able to think about it and then say they want to.</p>

<p>But Christians must only marry others who love the Lord. So we who say we're true Christians should not marry unbelievers, Roman Catholics, or other people who put idols above God. Neither should we marry people who lead terrible lives or who hold to false teachings that are "salvation issues".</p>

<p>4. We must not marry people who are more closely-related to us than the Bible allows. That would be incest, and would not be right even if the people involved gave their consent.</p>

<p>5. If a fiance or fiancee commits adultery or sleeps around when they're engaged, that's enough reason for the innocent person to break off the engagement. And if a husband or wife commits adultery after marriage, it's enough reason for the innocent person to get a divorce. If the divorce goes through, the innocent person can marry someone else, just as if the guilty person had died.</p>

<p>6. Men are sinful, and will try to come up with arguments that justify breaking apart marriage that God has joined together. However, divorce is only an option if the man or woman has committed adultery, or has deserted the marriage and it can't be remedied by the Church or civil authorities. In that case, the divorce proceedings must be public and orderly, and the man and woman must not to be left to their own wills and judgements in the matter.</p>
