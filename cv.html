 <li>Implemented many web-based internal tools, such as a photo album editor and a workflow system to help salespeople schedule photoshoots at hundreds of hotels per month.</li>
 <li>Wrote tools for our web infrastructure: a new <a href="http://tech.oyster.com/using-ansible-to-restore-developer-sanity/">code deployment system</a> using Ansible, tools to translate and localize the entire website, a data analytics pipeline using Snowplow Analytics and Amazon Redshift, and a system to send personalized emails.</li>
 <li>Managed the transition of our 12 points of sale from plain http to SSL while closely monitoring SEO performance.</li>
 <li>Co-wrote heavily parallelized software to resize and watermark millions of images in many different sizes using Amazon EC2.</li>

<h2 id='education'>Education</h2>

<p>I have a B.E. in electrical and computer engineering, and graduated from the <a href='http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/'>University of Canterbury</a> in 2002 with first class honors, <a href='http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courses/glossary.shtml#g' title='Scale: A+ is 9, D is 0'>GPA</a>&nbsp;7.9/9. For my final-year project I designed a small stack-based CPU in VHDL.</p>

<h2 id='aboutme'>About me</h2>

<p class='right-callout'>I have also discovered a truly marvelous proof of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_law">Hofstadter’s Law</a>, but unfortunately this margin is too narrow to contain it.</p>

<p>My dad taught me how to program by teaching me the Tao of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)'>Forth</a>. Two of my first projects were writing a Forth compiler in x86 assembly, and then writing a small 32-bit OS in my Forth. I love things small, fast, and light&nbsp;&ndash; and that’s paid off, especially in my embedded work.</p>

<p>Other than that, I enjoy reading and <a href="/writings/">writing</a>, and I edited and designed a <a href='/prism-magazine/'>small-scale magazine</a>. I’m into unicycling, typography, and piano. I love my wife and family. I aim to keep the commandments, but you may find me breaking the conventions.</p>
