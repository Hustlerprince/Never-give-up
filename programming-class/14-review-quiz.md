> These are my "teaching notes" for the fourteenth session of my [Computers and Programming Class](/programming-class/), which was a programming quiz based on the material I had already taught.


Programming quiz
================

1. What is a "computer"?

a) Someone who computes
b) A device that adds and multiplies numbers really fast
c) A machine that can be told to follow a sequence of instructions
d) All of the above

Answer: (d). The word originally meant a person who computes with numbers, but now we use it to mean a machine that follows instructions (a program), and most of the instructions are simply adding and multiplying numbers.


2. What does RAM stand for?

a) Readily Available Memory
b) Rare Art Module
c) Random Access Memory
d) Read-Actuated Memory

Answer: (c). Random Access Memory. It's called that because unlike a hard drive, the computer can access any random memory location instantly -- there's no waiting for moving parts to get into the right place to read it.


3. Why is the programming language Python called "Python"?

a) Because it's as slippery as a snake
b) After the British comedy show "Monty Python"
c) Because its logo is a python snake
d) Because it's good at drawing pie charts

Answer: (b). After the British comedy show "Monty Python". The original designer has quite a sense of humour, and many of the examples in the documentation are funny words or lines taken from the comedy show.


4. How many instructions per second can modern computers execute?

a) 50 thousand
b) 4 million
c) 2 billion
d) 10 trillion

Answer: (c). About two billion. When you see that a computer is so many gigahertz, the "giga" means billion ("mega" is million). And the "hertz" is not about pain -- it's a scientific term that means "number of times per second".


5. What part of the computer computes and executes the instructions?

a) The CPU (central processing unit)
b) The power supply
c) The RAM (random access memory)
d) The hard drive

Answer: (a). The CPU (central processing unit). This is the little black "chip" that does the adding and multiplying, and executes the instructions in each program. It's the main control unit. The RAM could also be considered part of the "brain" of the computer -- but it's the computer's memory, not the computation part.


6. What are the place values in a 4-bit binary number, from right to left?

a) 2, 4, 6, 8
b) 1, 2, 4, 8
c) 0, 1, 2, 3
d) 2, 4, 8, 16

Answer: (b). Just like decimal, the right-most place is the "one's place". Then each place to the left multiplies the value by two, so 1, 2, 4, and 8.


7. What is the decimal value of the binary number 1101?

a) 15
b) 7
c) 12
d) 13

Answer: (d). There's 1 in the one's place, four's place, and eight's place, so 1+4+8, which is 13.


8. What is the binary value of the decimal number 9?

a) 1001
b) 0111
c) 1000
d) 0101

Answer: (a). 9 is an 8 plus a 1, so there's 1 in the eight's place and in the one's place.


9. What is "caching"?

a) A programmer taking money to the bank
b) Storing a result in memory so it's quick to access next time
c) Accessing a "memory bank"
d) Saving something to disk


Answer: (b). Storing the result of a calculation or operation in memory so it's much quicker to access next time you need it. For example, some web page files are "cached" so that the website is faster to access the second time around.


10. How do you make text bold in an HTML web page?

a) <a>
b) <b>
c) <bold>
d) <p>

Answer: (b). HTML has many "tags", and the one to make text bold is <b>. Other tags are: <a> to make a link (anchor), <p> to make a paragraph, and <i> to make italics.


11. What does the following Python program do? [Write the two lines of code on the whiteboard]

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

a) Print the letter "i" five times
b) Print "SyntaxError"
c) Print the numbers from 0 through 4
d) Print the numbers from 1 through 5

Answer: (c). The "for i in range(5)" part makes the variable "i" count from 0 through 4. Then the "print(i)" prints the variable "i" each time around the loop. So the code prints the numbers from 0 through 4.


12. What is a variable in Python?


13. What does the "input" function do?


14. TODO
