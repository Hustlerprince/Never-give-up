Our three girls are homeschooled (mostly by my [lovely wife](https://aliensintheapple.com/)), and we're part of a Christian homeschooling co-op that meets every second Friday. After the first year in the co-op, one of the parents is required to help with or teach a class. So for the 2016-2017 school year, I offered to teach a computers and programming class to a group of ten high school age students.

Below is the course outline, with links to my "teaching notes" for each session:
