> These are my "teaching notes" for the first session of my [Computers and Programming Class](/programming-class/).


Course outline
--------------

Today I'll mostly be talking about what computers are at a basic level, and I'll give you a bit of history on when and how they were invented.

In the five sessions after this week here's what we'll be doing:

* Next time we'll take a computer apart and look at all the different components inside and talk about how they work: like the main processor, memory, the hard disk, etc.
* In the third session we'll look at ones and zeros: the binary number system and a bit of computer math.
* In session four we'll talk about networks and the internet, and what happens when you go to a website.
* In session five we'll look at *software* and write our first computer program.
* In session six we'll dive deeper into programming languages and start looking at Python, which is the main programming language we'll use for the rest of the course.

That will bring us through to the end of the year, around Christmas. Next year we have ten more sessions where we'll really learn how to program using the Python language. We'll create our own little graphical game in Python, probably our own version of Tetris of Space Invaders or something like that.

In the last session we'll look briefly at *source control* using GitHub, one of the main sites people use to store their computer programs. We'll even build a small website using GitHub Pages.


Expectations
------------

So, what are my expectations for you? Well, first of all -- this class is going to be quite hard. Not impossible, but challenging. You all signed up for this because you have some interest in computers or programming. So do I. In fact, I really love programming and want you to catch something of how cool it is to be able to tell a computer what to do.

I've put a fair bit of time into preparing for this course, so I expect you to pull your weight too. Every week I'll give you some homework. For the first part of the course it won't be much, but next year when we're really getting into the meat of programming there will be an assignment that will take you a couple of hours. But co-op is only every second week, so I don't think one hour of homework each week is too much to ask.

I want to make this real, so there will be consequences if you don't do the work: if you miss the homework three times during the course, you'll have to drop out of the course. You don't necessarily have to get it right or even finish it, but you have to show a reasonable attempt. And to keep you motivated there'll be small prizes every week for the three people who do the best homework.

So those are my expectations. But we've got a lot of fun stuff ahead of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the course. Fair enough?


Jobs in computer programming
----------------------------

One of the great things about computer programming is that there are a lot of jobs out there, and they pay very well. This course isn't going to land you a job, but if you do want to study computer programming at college (they call it *computer science*) or even on your own after this, you'll have a head start.

To get a computer programming job, it helps to have a college degree, but if you're a go-getter even that's not required -- mainly you have to show people what you can build.

What kinds of jobs are available?

1. You could work at a startup company, and help them build their website. Usually that doesn't mean just a simple web page, but develop the databases and code for a custom website that performs something useful, say Gmail for example, or a shopping website, or a website that helps you manage your money.

2. You could work at a large, established company like Google or Microsoft. At a large company you'd usually be building a small piece of what they do, for example the chat feature of Gmail, or the login screen for Windows 10.

3. And you could work in entertainment or video games, for example working on the 3D graphics for a Pixar movie, or helping write the next version of Angry Birds.

4. You could work in finance, meaning write computer programs to move money around, that sort of thing.

5. You could work in science, writing programs that analyze weather information, or that help researchers find patterns in data, or that simulate someone's heart beating.

6. You could work in *embedded programming*, meaning writing programs for the tiny microchips that go inside microwaves, mobile phones, cars, etc.

So there's a lot out there, and I just wanted to whet your appetite. Again, you won't be able to get a job just from this course, but hopefully you'll have a head start if you do want to head in that direction. If not, let's just have fun learning!


What are computers?
-------------------

* little electronic devices that can add and multiply numbers really fast
* everything your computer does is manipulate numbers, over and over, really fast, and never gets bored
* letters are numbers, pictures are lots of numbers, movies are lots and lots of numbers ... everything on your computer has been turned into numbers, because that's the only thing computers can handle
* examples of computers
  - homework: count the number of computers in your home - win a prize for the most


Computer history
----------------

* tabulating machines, 1890 census
* early 1900's - 1960 IBM made these
* punch cards (give them a punch card each)
* electronic computers (valve? the transistor)
* minicomputers, mainframes
* PCs! 1980s
* smart phones and devices
* storage, peripherals, monitors (tube vs LCD)
* speed over time (Moore's Law?)
  - from 2 punch cards per second (IBM tabulating machine) to 2 billion instructions per second (that's a billion times as fast)
