More on HTML
------------

At the end of last week I kind of rushed you through a few things about HTML for your homework assignment. I was going to use this lesson to talk about *software*, but I think the web is important enough that I want to flesh out HTML a bit more. We'll get to software next time.

"HTML" stands for HyperText Markup Language, and "hypertext" basically means you can link from one document to another. I think most of you had links from your page to other pages in your homework, which is great -- *linking* is probably the oldest and most important feature of the web.
